# Research
<log_linear.py>
It takes values that are in log (base10) and their uncertainties 
and covert them into linear scale with new uncertanties in linear scale.
This is useful when you come across values in log10 scale on research papers but you want original values.

<magnitude_calculator.py>
This executes the conversion between apparent and absolute magnitudes of any star with known distance.
If the distance and apparent magnitude are given, it finds the absolute magnitude. 
If the distance and absolite magnitude are given, it finds the apparent magnitude.
